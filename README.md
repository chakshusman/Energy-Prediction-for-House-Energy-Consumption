# Energy-Prediction-for-House-Energy-Consumption


Project Overview:
The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to forecast energy consumption in residential spaces. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and thorough analysis, the model aids in understanding and predicting household energy usage based on environmental variables.

Key Highlights:

Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between various features. Identified the most influential factors affecting energy consumption.

Algorithms Implemented: Utilized an array of algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, GradientBoosting, XGB, and MLP Classifier, to predict energy consumption accurately.
ROC Curve Comparison: Plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves with Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores for all algorithms in a single graph. This comparison facilitated a clear evaluation of their performance.
Best Performing Model: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 89% with the SVC model using RBF Kernel. This accuracy was attained while ensuring the avoidance of overfitting through rigorous Hyperpa
