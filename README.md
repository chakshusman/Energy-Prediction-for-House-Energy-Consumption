# Energy-Prediction-for-House-Energy-Consumption

This project involves building a robust Machine Learning model to forecast a house's energy consumption based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and more.

Key Highlights:
Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between various features. Identified the most influential factors affecting energy consumption.
Algorithms Implemented: Utilized an array of algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, GradientBoosting, XGB, and MLP Classifier, to predict energy consumption accurately.
ROC Curve Comparison: Plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves with Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores for all algorithms in a single graph. This comparison facilitated a clear evaluation of their performance.
Best Performing Model: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 89% with the SVC model using RBF Kernel. This accuracy was attained while ensuring the avoidance of overfitting through rigorous Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
